            <p>
                For mobile phones which is indeed the smallest version of media queries we can use 
                a minimum width of 320 px, to a maximum width of 480px
                because they're portrait have a bigger heigth than width
            </p>

            <h2>FOR TABLETS AND IPADS</h2>
            <p>
                For Tablets and Ipads which are  of the landscape version of media queries we can use 
                a minimum width of 481 px, to a maximum width of 767px here
                because they're relatively wide and have a bigger width than height

            <p>We can accept that the television in our various home are bigger 
                than our phone and laptop sizes, it is no doubt their media queries 
                should be different 1201px and more</p>
